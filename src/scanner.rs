/// It consists of multiple DFAs that are used to search for matches.

/// Each DFA corresponds to a terminal symbol (token type) the lexer/scanner can recognize.
/// The DFAs are advanced in parallel to search for matches.
/// It further constists of at least one scanner mode. Scanners support multiple scanner modes.
/// This feature is known from Flex as *Start conditions* and provides more
/// flexibility by defining several scanners for several parts of your grammar.
/// See <https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/c/software/flex/flex.html#SEC11>
/// for more information.

/// To create a scanner, you can use the `ScannerBuilder` to add scanner mode data.
/// At least one scanner mode must be added to the scanner. This is usually the mode named `INITIAL`.
